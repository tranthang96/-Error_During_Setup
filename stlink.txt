How did you install stlink?
If you do the following you should not need sudo to run the commands (so long as it is not run as root):

git clone https://github.com/texane/stlink.git
cd stlink/build
cmake ..
make && sudo make install
Note that you may also need to update your udev rules if you have not already.
stlink_udev_rule.tar.bz2
sudo tar -xvf stlink_udev_rule.tar.bz2 -C /etc/udev/rules.d
